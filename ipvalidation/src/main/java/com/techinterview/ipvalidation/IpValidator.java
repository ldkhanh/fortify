    /**
     * Implement the function that validates if provided IP address is in the range defined by cidrRange parameter.
     * You can read about CIDR here https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Classless_Inter-Domain_Routing
     * Also, you can use this page https://www.ipaddressguide.com/cidr to understand better CIDR concept.
     *
     * Code organization, implementing other functions that are called from validateAddress - all of this up to you.
     * The final code must be compilable, buildable and tested.
     *
     * You are free to use any build framework to build the code (maven, gradle, ant, etc.).
     *
     * You can use any java version for development (8, 9, 10, 11).
     *
     * You can use any libraries to simplify any auxiliary logic (e.g. string parsing).
     * But you cannot use any 3rd party libraries to implement validation itself.
     *
     * Testing framework selection is up to you. Testing the logic from "public static void main" is also OK.
     *
     * If you are familiar with Git, do your work in a branch and create pull request.
     *
     * @param ipAddress String representation of IP address that needs to be validated.
     *                  Function must verify that IP address definition itself is valid.
     *                  If IP address format is invalid, function must throw IllegalArgumentException.
     *                  E.g. 192.168.0.1 is correct definition of IP address.
     *                  256.0.0.1, 192,168.o.1, 192,168.0.1 are examples of invalid IP addresses.
     * @param cidrRange Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR) definition that defines range of allowed IP addresses.
     *                  For example 11.1.0.0/24 CIDR defines IP addresses range from 11.1.0.0 to 11.1.0.255
     *                  Function must verify that cidrRange definition itself is valid.
     *                  If cidrRange format is invalid, function must throw IllegalArgumentException.
     *                  E.g. 192.168.0.0/24, 100.0.0.0/16, 10.10.0.0/32, 10.10.0.1/16 are valid definitions.
     *                  192.168.0.0/35, 300.0.0.0/16, 10.10,0.0/32, 10.10.0.256/16 are invalid definitions
     *                  If slash is omitted in cidrRange definition, you can assume that / 32 is used.
     *                  E.g. cidrRange 10.10.0.1 can be treated as 10.10.0.1/32
     * @throws IllegalArgumentException if either ipAddress or cidrRange definitions is invalid.
     * @return true if provided IP address is covered by the CIDR range; false otherwise.
